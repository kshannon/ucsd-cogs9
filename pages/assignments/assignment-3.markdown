1. What are the definitions of independent variables and dependent variables?
> **Explanatory (Independent) Variables** are defined as the following:<br/>
> It explains variations in the response variable, this is the variable a research would change.

> **Response (Dependent) Variables** are defined as the following:<br/>
> This is either a predicted value, or a value explained by the explanatory variable. This is the measured outcome in an experiment.
2. How many parameters are required to find the p-values?
> You can choose whatever combination you have as long as the p-value is less than 0.05. Just make sure that you write down the parameters sufficiently clearly, so your results can be easily replicated.
3. Do we need to include the parameters under “Other options”?
